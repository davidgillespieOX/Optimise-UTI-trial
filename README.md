# Optimise-UTI-trial
Simulation code for Optimise UTI trial - adapted from work outlined in the following two papers:

Quartagno M, Walker AS, Carpenter JR, Phillips PP, Parmar MK. Rethinking non-inferiority: a practical trial design for optimising treatment duration. Clinical Trials. 2018 Oct;15(5):477-88.

Quartagno M, Carpenter JR, Walker AS, Clements M, Parmar MK. The DURATIONS randomised trial design: Estimation targets, analysis methods and operating characteristics. Clinical Trials. 2020 Dec;17(6):644-53.

Simulations run separately for lower and upper UTI sub-trials

Process to run simulations outlined below:

1. Run simulation parameters code
2. Run data generation code
3. Run results for Table 2 from 2018 paper
4. Run results from Table 2 of 2020 paper
5. Run Figure 4 from 2020 paper
